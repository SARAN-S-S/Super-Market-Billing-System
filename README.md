Supermarket Billing System

Why This Project?

The Supermarket Billing System is a basic yet essential project that helps in understanding key concepts of C++ programming, including file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and user interactions. This project was chosen because it provides a hands-on approach to learning practical programming skills while also implementing real-world functionalities like product management, billing, and administrative control.

Project Overview

This project is a console-based application developed in C++ with file handling for data storage. It simulates a simple supermarket billing system where an admin can manage products and a buyer can view and purchase items.

Functionalities

1. Admin Functionalities

Add Product: Admin can add new products with details like name, product ID, price, and quantity.

Edit Product: Update details of an existing product.

Remove Product: Delete a product from the inventory.

View Products: Display all available products with their details.

2. Buyer Functionalities

View Products: Buyers can see all the available products and their prices.

Purchase Products: Select products and quantities to generate a bill.

Bill Calculation: Automatically calculates the total amount, including quantity-based pricing.

3. File Handling

All product details are stored in a file (database.txt), allowing data persistence even after the program closes.

The system reads and writes product data from this file for inventory management.
