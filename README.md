# Supermarket Billing and Management System 
The Supermarket Billing and Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ with file handling for data storage. This project was chosen because it provides a hands-on approach to learning key programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user interactions. It implements real-world functionalities like product management, billing, and administrative control.

🔹 Why This Project?

This project is a basic yet essential system that helps in understanding the fundamentals of C++ programming while also incorporating real-world applications. It serves as a foundation for learning and can be expanded with more functionalities in the future.

📌 Project Overview :

The Supermarket Billing System allows an admin to manage products and a buyer to purchase items. The system maintains product details using file handling, ensuring that the data is saved even after the program exits.
