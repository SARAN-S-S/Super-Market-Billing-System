# Supermarket Billing and Management System 
The Supermarket Billing and Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ with file handling for data storage. This project was chosen because it provides a hands-on approach to learning key programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user interactions. It implements real-world functionalities like product management, billing, and administrative control.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Project?

        This project is a basic yet essential system that helps in understanding the fundamentals of C++ programming while also incorporating real-world applications. It serves as a foundation for learning and can be expanded with more functionalities in the future.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview :

        The Supermarket Billing System allows an admin to manage products and a buyer to purchase items. The system maintains product details using file handling, ensuring that the data is saved even after the program exits.

âš¡ Functionalities :

ðŸ›  Admin Functionalities :

ðŸ”¹Add Product â€“ Add new products with details like name, product ID, price, and quantity.

ðŸ”¹Edit Product â€“ Update details of an existing product.

ðŸ”¹Remove Product â€“ Delete a product from the inventory.

ðŸ”¹View Products â€“ Display all available products with their details.

ðŸ›’ Buyer Functionalities :

ðŸ”¹View Products â€“ See all available products and their prices.

ðŸ”¹Purchase Products â€“ Select products and specify the quantity for purchase.

ðŸ”¹Bill Calculation â€“ Automatically calculates the total amount based on selected products.

ðŸ’¾ File Handling :

ðŸ”¹Data Persistence â€“ Product details are stored in a file (database.txt) to retain inventory information even after the program closes.

ðŸ”¹Efficient Management â€“ The system reads and writes product data for inventory management.
